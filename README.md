managing your git.

    -h, --help       Print help information
    -V, --version    Print version information

SUBCOMMANDS:
    checkout     To switch between git clients
    configure    To help the user configure their git client using vscode or any other editor
    help         Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

```

This is an attempt to make a git profile switcher as we all know that it is freaking irritating to have to type in the git profile and handling multiple ssh keys every time we want to switch profiles. right ? so here we go.

```csharp
program_status:"just started"
```
